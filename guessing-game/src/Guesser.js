// Guessing Game
// Objective
// Create a command line based number guessing game, where users have to guess a number between 1 and 10. Build the application in a series of iterations, with each iteration being a functional (though incomplete) version of the final application.

// Skills Required
// Console I/O
// Random number generation
// IDE familiarity
// Basic types
// If statements
// Equality operators
// Loops
// Iterations
// Build the application in the following small iterations. It should function at completion of each iteration!

// When the user guesses 7, the game announces they have won. All other numbers lose.
// When the user guesses 0, the game provides instructions for the user.
// After guessing, the user can take one more guess (unless they won!)
// When the user guesses -1, the application should exit.
// The game should provide feedback that the secret number is > or < any incorrect guesses.
// The number should be random, instead of always 7.
// Stretch task: Give the user 3 tries before announcing they have lost.
